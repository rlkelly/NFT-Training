# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help

npx truffle run verify <Contract>@<ContractAddress> --network <NETWORK>
```

REPLACE:
  INFURA_API_KEY with your api key for infura.io
  ETHERSCAN_API_KEY with etherscan api key for verifying contracts
  replace WALLET_MNEUMONIC with your wallet mnemonic phrase
